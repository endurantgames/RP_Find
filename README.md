# rpFind

rpFind is an addon for World of Warcraft that lets you locate other roleplayers.

It works in conjunction with all of the major roleplaying addons -- 
Total RP 3, MyRolePlay, etc --
or can be run without any of those.

## Current Status

~~Since I no longer play World of Warcraft, this addon is no longer being maintained.~~
~~Therefore I have converted this repository to a "public archive"~~

Update as of 2022/09/11:

I've started playing WoW again! Therefore I feel obligated to go back to working on this.
I've unarchived the repositories for this and other RP\_\* addons on GitHub, and will be
updating their Interface numbers to the current Wow (retail) versions.
