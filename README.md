# rpFind

rpFind is an addon for World of Warcraft that lets you locate other roleplayers.

It works in conjunction with all of the major roleplaying addons -- 
Total RP 3, MyRolePlay, etc --
or can be run without any of those.

## Current Status

Since I no longer play World of Warcraft, this addon is no longer being maintained.
Therefore I have converted this repository to a "public archive"
